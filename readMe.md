### Health Monitoring App Architecture

The app can be divided into two primary components: **Patient App** and **Admin Dashboard** (which can be web-based). Here's a complete application architecture based on the provided requirements, with additional AI-driven features:

---

## **1. Architecture Overview**

- **Frontend**
  - **Patient App**: Built using **React Native** (for cross-platform mobile apps).
  - **Admin Dashboard**: Web-based, built using **React**.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for API endpoints.
- **Database**: Use JSON-based storage (like **MongoDB**) for document-style data storage.
- **AI Integration**: Leverage AI for predictive health analysis, suggestions, and interactive health monitoring using **Machine Learning models** and **NLP**.

---

## **2. Features and Pages**

### **Patient App (React Native)**
1. **Login System**
   - Multi-device login for patients (OAuth2 / JWT authentication).
   - Token-based session management.

2. **Pages**
   - **A. Patient Details**
     - Basic info like name, age, gender, medical history.
     - Profile editing with permissions managed by the admin.
   
   - **B. Daily Record**
     - Form to log daily health metrics (e.g., blood pressure, glucose levels, heart rate).
     - Smart device integration for wearables (e.g., smartwatches) to automatically log health data.

   - **C. Patient Medicine Summary**
     - List of prescribed medicines with dosage and schedules.
     - AI suggestions for medication based on daily records and health status.
     
   - **D. Patient Diet Plan**
     - AI-recommended diet plans based on logged health data, lifestyle, and medical history.
     - Custom diet plans managed by the admin.
     
   - **E. Patient Files (Images/Docs)**
     - Upload and view medical reports, images (X-rays, MRIs), and documents.
     - Document scanner for easy upload of physical files.
     
   - **F. Health Monitoring**
     - Graphical display of daily health metrics (like charts/graphs for heart rate, blood pressure).
     - AI-powered health status prediction, alerting the patient of potential risks.

3. **AI-Powered Features (Patient Side)**
   - **Predictive Health Monitoring**
     - AI models analyze daily health logs and suggest early warnings (e.g., "Potential Risk for Hypertension").
   
   - **Medicine Suggestion**
     - AI recommends adjustments to medication (with admin/doctor verification).
   
   - **Diet Recommendations**
     - AI suggests changes to the diet based on health data and wearable inputs.
   
   - **Health Query AI Assistant**
     - Patients can ask health-related questions to an AI chatbot.
     - The AI gives advice or suggests consultation with a doctor if necessary.

### **Admin Dashboard (React)**
1. **Login System**
   - Admin authentication with role-based access controls (RBAC).

2. **Pages**
   - **A. Summary Dashboard**
     - Overview of patient count, total devices, product inventory, and alerts.
     - Graphs showing trends in patient health (e.g., average blood pressure levels across patients).
   
   - **B. Create Patient**
     - Form to add new patients.
     - AI-driven recommendation for initial health assessment based on input data.
   
   - **C. Patient List with Graphs**
     - List of patients with real-time health data plotted in graphs (e.g., glucose trends).
     - Search and filter by health condition or metric.
   
   - **D. Pages Permission List**
     - Control permissions for each patient page (e.g., access to diet plan, medical summary).
     - Only admin can grant/restrict permissions.
   
   - **E. Add Products**
     - Add new medical products (medicines, equipment) into inventory.
     
   - **F. Add Stock Inventory**
     - Add stock of medicines or medical products.
     
   - **G. Update Inventory**
     - Manage inventory updates and track stock availability.

3. **AI-Powered Features (Admin Side)**
   - **Predictive Patient Monitoring**
     - Admin dashboard shows AI-predicted health risks (e.g., "Patient X may develop hypertension").
     
   - **Automated Health Alerts**
     - If certain health metrics cross thresholds (e.g., blood pressure > 140), an alert is sent to both patient and admin.
     
   - **Medicine Stock Prediction**
     - AI predicts medicine usage and suggests stock replenishment.
   
   - **Diet Plan Suggestions**
     - AI assists the admin in generating diet plans for patients based on their health records.

## **3. Core Technologies and Stack**

### **Frontend**
- **React Native**: For the Patient mobile app, ensuring it works across both Android and iOS.
- **React.js**: For the Admin Dashboard.
- **Chart.js / D3.js**: For plotting health graphs in both the patient app and the admin dashboard.
- **JWT**: For secure login and token-based session management.

### **Backend (Node.js)**
- **Node.js with Express.js**: To handle RESTful API endpoints for data retrieval and updates.
- **Socket.io**: For real-time updates (e.g., live health data from wearables).

### **Database (NoSQL)**
- **MongoDB**: For storing patient records, daily logs, medical files, and admin records in a JSON format.

### **AI & Machine Learning Integration**
- **TensorFlow.js** / **PyTorch**: For health prediction models (e.g., predicting risks of diabetes, hypertension).
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: For the AI chatbot feature where patients can ask health-related questions.
  
### **Wearable Device Integration**
- **Google Fit API** / **Apple HealthKit**: For integrating health metrics from smartwatches and other wearables into the app.

## **4. AI-Powered Features Expansion**

- **AI-Driven Health Recommendations**: Machine learning models can analyze daily health logs and generate personalized recommendations for medicines, diet plans, and lifestyle changes.
  
- **AI-Powered Health Risk Alerts**: The app can automatically alert patients and admins when specific health metrics reach dangerous levels.

- **AI Chatbot**: The chatbot would answer basic health-related queries from patients, provide advice on common symptoms, and suggest whether a doctor's visit is needed.

- **Daily Health Q&A**: The app could prompt patients to answer health-related questions daily (e.g., "How are you feeling today?") and use their answers to improve health suggestions.

---

## **5. Home Monitoring Integration**
  
- **Smartwatch Support**: Integration with wearable devices (smartwatches, fitness bands) to collect real-time health metrics such as heart rate, blood oxygen level, sleep patterns, etc.
  
- **AI-Driven Diet Plans**: Personalized diet plans updated based on real-time health data from the patient and AI-driven insights on improving health.

---

## **6. Security and Compliance**
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Ensure all patient data is encrypted (both at rest and in transit).
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: To ensure that only admins have access to sensitive data and patient permissions.
